            <dt><dfn>user agent</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the

        <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

        <p>
            This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
            implications of deploying this specification into production environments.

    <section class="informative">
        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

        <p>
            There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
            aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
            not understanding the implications of this section can result in
            security vulnerabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
            considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
            advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
            critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.

    <section class="informative">
        <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

        <p>
            There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
            aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
            standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
            this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
            to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
            all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
            especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
            have historically created problems for assistive technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
            This section details the general accessibility considerations to take into
            account when utilizing this data model.

    <section class="informative">
        <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

        <p>
            There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
            aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
            standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
            difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
            languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
            specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.
        </p>

        <p>
            This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into
            account when utilizing this data model.
